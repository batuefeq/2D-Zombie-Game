The sounds included here are intended for the following uses: Cinematic, ambient and material impacts. Please feel free to play around with them. Implementation of sounds will be up to the end user, as Kloudy is not a script knowledged individual / entity. I look forward to bringing more realistic sounds in the future and hope these sounds serve others well. Please note some sounds may be longer than necessary, edit them for efficiency.
